# 📊 Sales Data Analysis with Tableau

Welcome to the **Sales Data Analysis** project! In this project, I analyzed a sales dataset using **Tableau** to uncover key insights, trends, and patterns. The dataset includes various sales-related metrics, and the goal was to visualize and explore how different factors such as regions, products, and time periods impact sales performance.
